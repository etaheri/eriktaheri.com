title: "Why I'm Writing"

I've been building software for over a decade now. Interactive WebGL experiences at creative agencies, platform engineering at growth-stage startups, and most recently leading engineering at an early-stage company. Through all of it, I never made time to write.

That changes here.

Most of what I've learned has come from other engineers who took the time to share what they know. Blog posts that saved me days of debugging. Talks that shifted how I think about architecture. README files that were clearly written by someone who cared.

I want to give some of that back. Just honest writing about what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and what I've gotten wrong.

## What to expect

Building and leading engineering teams. Tools and patterns I actually use. Side projects and whatever I'm tinkering with. Probably some strong opinions about startups and fintech sprinkled in.

I've started and abandoned blogs before. The difference this time is I'm not trying to build an audience or game an algorithm. This is just a place to think out loud. If something I write helps someone, cool.

More to come.
